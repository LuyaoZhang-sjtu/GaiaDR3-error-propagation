# GaiaDR3-error-propagation
We present the implementation of linear error propagation, second-order error propagation, and the Monte Carlo (MC) method for transforming Gaia DR3 data, including radial velocity (RV) information, from celestial coordinates to both equatorial and galactic Cartesian coordinates.
